    <p class="p1">4. Cloudflare Nameservers</p>
    <p class="p2">How are Cloudflare's nameservers different from the DNS provided by Google DNS or OpenDNS? Can I
        delegate to Cloudflare nameservers while still using my host’s DNS?
    <p>
        <hr>
    <p class="p3">Dear User,</p>
    <p class="p3">Thank you for reaching out about your questions related to Cloudflare DNS nameservers.</p>
    <p class="p3">Cloudflare's nameservers differ from public DNS providers like Google DNS or OpenDNS in several key
        ways:</p>
    <p class="p3"><b>1. Authoritative vs. Recursive.</b><br>Cloudflare nameservers are authoritative for domains using
        their services. This means they hold the actual DNS records for those domains. Google DNS and OpenDNS are
        recursive DNS resolvers. They look up DNS information from authoritative servers but don't host the records
        themselves.</p>
    <p class="p3"><b>2. DNS Management.</b><br>With Cloudflare, you can manage your DNS records directly through their
        interface. Google DNS and OpenDNS don't provide DNS management - they only resolve DNS queries.</p>
    <p class="p3"><b>3. Additional Services.</b><br>Cloudflare integrates DNS with their CDN, DDoS protection, and other
        web performance/security services. Google DNS and OpenDNS focus primarily on DNS resolution, though OpenDNS
        offers some security features.</p>
    <p class="p3"><b>4. Proxying.</b><br>Cloudflare can act as a reverse proxy for your traffic, hiding your origin
        server's IP. Google DNS and OpenDNS don't offer this services.</p>
    <p class="p3">Regarding your second question: Yes, you can delegate to Cloudflare nameservers while still using your
        host's DNS, with following considerations:</p>
    <p class="p3"><b>1. Partial DNS Delegation.</b><br>You can use Cloudflare for specific subdomains or records while
        keeping others on your host's DNS. This clould be done through CNAME or NS records.</p>
    <p class="p3"><b>2. Propagation Time.</b><br>Changes may take time to propagate when switching between or using
        multiple DNS providers.</p>
    <p class="p3">If you're considering this setup, it's important to plan carefully to avoid disruptions.</p>

        and I will be happy to assist you further.</p>
